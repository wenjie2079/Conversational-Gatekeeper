# Conversational-Gatekeeper
Project Overview
Ever wanted to unlock your digital fortresses by sweet-talking an AI rather than pecking in some ancient password? This project explores the thrilling idea of replacing passwords with a conversation that persuades an LLM (Large Language Model) or AI that you are indeed you—and not some sniveling impostor.

Instead of memorizing “p@ssw0rd!” or fiddling with multi-factor tokens, you’ll engage in a chat with your AI bouncer. It will ask you all the clever personal cues and inside jokes only the real you would know. Once it’s convinced (or charmed), voilà—you’re in.
